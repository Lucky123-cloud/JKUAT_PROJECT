Explain the following terms:
i. Connection-oriented service - Topic[computer network - communication models(OSI/TCP models)]
ii. Server Topic[computer Networks - Network Devices/Architecture]
iii. System conversion - Topic[System Developemt Life Cycle(SDLC)]
iv. IP Address - Topic[Networking - IP Addressing]
v. Subnet mask - Topic [Networking - IP Addressin/Subnetting]

i) Connection-oriented service - A communication where a connection is first established between a sender and a receiver before data is sent.
eg TCP (Transmision Control Protocol)
pros: Ensure reliable delivery, Acknowledges data received, used in application like email, web browsing, file transfer.

ii) Server - is a computer that provides resources, services, or data to other computers(called clients) over a network

iii) System Conversion - is the process of switching from an old information system to a new one

iv) IP Address - is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the internet protocol for communication
                - A unique number assigned to each device on a network.

v) Subnet mask - A 32-bit number that splits IP addresses into network and host portions, used to create subnets for efficient IP management.
