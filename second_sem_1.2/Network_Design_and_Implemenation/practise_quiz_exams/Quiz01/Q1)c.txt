i) Distinguish between cross-over cable and straight-through cable:

straight-through cables are cables used to different types of devices(eg. computer to router) whereas 
cross-over cables are used to connect similar types of devices.

Topic:
Network Cabling â€” Ethernet Cable Types (Straight-through vs Cross-over cables)

Answer:

Aspect: Straight-through Cable vs Cross-over Cable

Definition:
- Straight-through Cable: A cable that connects different types of devices (e.g., computer to switch, router to switch) by keeping the wiring order the same on both ends.
- Cross-over Cable: A cable that connects similar types of devices (e.g., computer to computer, switch to switch) by crossing over the transmit and receive pairs.

Wiring Configuration:
- Straight-through Cable: Pin 1 connects to Pin 1, Pin 2 to Pin 2, and so on. (Same order at both ends, usually T568A-T568A or T568B-T568B.)
- Cross-over Cable: The send and receive wires are crossed. (One end wired T568A, other end T568B.)

Typical Use:
- Straight-through Cable: 
  - PC to Switch/Hub
  - Router to Switch
  - PC to Modem
- Cross-over Cable:
  - PC to PC
  - Switch to Switch (older switches)
  - Router to Router (without uplink port)

Modern Relevance:
- Straight-through Cable: Still used, though modern devices often support "auto-MDI/MDIX," which can automatically adjust.
- Cross-over Cable: Less common today because of auto-sensing ports, but still important to know for manual setups or older devices.

Simple Trick to Remember:
- Straight-through = Different devices
- Cross-over = Same devices
