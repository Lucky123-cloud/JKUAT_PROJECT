QUESTION: Discuss the implementation of the following signal encoding schemes:
           i) NRZ-L
           ii) ASK
           iii) PSK
           iv) FSK
=============================================================================

=============================================================================
i) NON-RETURN TO ZERO LEVEL (NRZ-L)
=============================================================================

Definition:
------------
NRZ-L (Non-Return to Zero-Level) is a binary encoding technique where the voltage
level of the signal is directly related to the bit value being transmitted.

Implementation:
----------------
- A logical '1' is represented by a **high voltage level**.
- A logical '0' is represented by a **low voltage level** (or vice versa, depending on convention).
- The signal level remains constant during the bit interval.
- There is **no neutral or rest state** between bits.

Advantages:
-----------
+ Simple to implement.
+ Requires less bandwidth than some other line coding techniques.

Disadvantages:
---------------
- Long sequences of identical bits cause synchronization issues.
- No inherent error detection.

=============================================================================
ii) AMPLITUDE SHIFT KEYING (ASK)
=============================================================================

Definition:
------------
ASK is a digital modulation technique where the **amplitude** of the carrier wave 
is varied in accordance with the digital data being transmitted.

Implementation:
----------------
- A binary '1' is transmitted using a **high amplitude carrier**.
- A binary '0' is transmitted using a **low (or zero) amplitude carrier**.
- The frequency and phase of the carrier remain constant.

Advantages:
-----------
+ Simple and easy to implement.
+ Effective for low-bandwidth applications.

Disadvantages:
---------------
- Highly susceptible to noise and interference.
- Not suitable for high-speed communication.

=============================================================================
iii) PHASE SHIFT KEYING (PSK)
=============================================================================

Definition:
------------
PSK is a digital modulation technique in which the **phase** of the carrier signal 
is changed to represent digital data.

Implementation:
----------------
- Common types include BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), QPSK (Quadrature PSK), etc.
- In BPSK:
   * Binary '0' → 0° phase
   * Binary '1' → 180° phase
- In QPSK:
   * Each symbol represents 2 bits using 4 distinct phases (e.g., 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°).

Advantages:
-----------
+ More noise resistant than ASK.
+ Higher bandwidth efficiency (especially QPSK).

Disadvantages:
---------------
- More complex to implement (requires accurate phase synchronization).
- Susceptible to phase jitter.

=============================================================================
iv) FREQUENCY SHIFT KEYING (FSK)
=============================================================================

Definition:
------------
FSK is a digital modulation technique in which the **frequency** of the carrier 
signal is changed to represent digital data.

Implementation:
----------------
- A binary '1' is represented by a **higher frequency** carrier.
- A binary '0' is represented by a **lower frequency** carrier.
- The amplitude remains constant throughout.

Types:
-------
- BFSK (Binary FSK) for 2 frequencies.
- MFSK (Multiple FSK) for more symbols.

Advantages:
-----------
+ More noise-resistant than ASK.
+ Suitable for radio communication.

Disadvantages:
---------------
- Requires more bandwidth than ASK and PSK.
- More complex transmitter and receiver design.
