PRINCIPLE OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATION
=============================================================================

Wireless communication is the transfer of information between two or more points 
that are not connected by an electrical conductor (i.e., without physical wires). 
It uses electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves, to carry signals over the air.

Key Principle:
---------------
Wireless communication systems rely on the **transmission and reception of 
electromagnetic signals** through the air.

Basic Steps in Wireless Communication:
---------------------------------------
1. **Transmission** – The sender converts the data into an electrical signal.
2. **Modulation** – The signal is modulated (combined) with a carrier wave.
3. **Propagation** – The modulated signal is transmitted over a wireless medium.
4. **Reception** – The receiver captures the signal using an antenna.
5. **Demodulation** – The carrier wave is removed to retrieve the original signal.
6. **Decoding** – The received data is decoded and presented in usable form.

Examples of Wireless Communication:
-----------------------------------
- Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)
- Bluetooth
- Mobile networks (3G, 4G, 5G)
- Satellite communication
- Radio and Television broadcasting

TWO DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION
=============================================================================

=======================================================
1. FREQUENCY SELECTION
=======================================================
Description:
- Frequency determines how far and how fast a signal can travel.
- Different frequencies have different propagation characteristics.

Considerations:
+ Lower frequencies (e.g., below 1 GHz) travel farther and penetrate obstacles better.
+ Higher frequencies (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz) support higher data rates but are more easily absorbed by walls and obstacles.

Impact:
- Must balance between coverage area and data rate depending on the application (e.g., rural vs. urban).

=======================================================
2. POWER CONSUMPTION
=======================================================
Description:
- Wireless devices are often battery-powered, especially in mobile and IoT devices.

Considerations:
+ Lower power usage extends device life and reduces heat.
+ Higher power may be needed for long-range transmission or overcoming interference.

Impact:
- Must optimize hardware and software to balance performance with battery life.
- Protocols like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are designed with this in mind.

=============================================================================
SUMMARY
=============================================================================

Wireless communication allows the exchange of information without physical 
connections, using electromagnetic waves. Effective system design requires careful 
consideration of frequency usage and power consumption to ensure reliable, 
efficient, and sustainable operation.
