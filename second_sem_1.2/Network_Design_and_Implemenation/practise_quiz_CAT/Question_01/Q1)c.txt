Describe any 3 topologies, and in each add 2 advantages and disadvantages

===============================
      NETWORK TOPOLOGIES      
===============================

1. BUS TOPOLOGY
----------------
Description:
- All devices are connected to a single central cable (bus).
- Data travels in both directions; only the target device accepts it.

Advantages:
+ Cost-effective – requires less cabling.
+ Easy to set up for small networks.

Disadvantages:
- Performance drops as devices increase.
- Failure in the main cable affects the whole network.

--------------------------------

2. STAR TOPOLOGY
----------------
Description:
- All devices are connected to a central hub or switch.
- Data goes through the hub before reaching the destination.

Advantages:
+ Easy to troubleshoot and manage.
+ Devices can be added/removed easily.

Disadvantages:
- Hub is a single point of failure.
- More cabling increases setup cost.

--------------------------------

3. RING TOPOLOGY
----------------
Description:
- Devices are connected in a closed loop.
- Data travels in one direction (or both in dual ring).

Advantages:
+ No data collisions.
+ Predictable data flow.

Disadvantages:
- Break in the ring disables the whole network.
- Adding/removing devices can disrupt the ring.

--------------------------------

4. MESH TOPOLOGY
----------------
Description:
- Each device is connected to every other device (full or partial mesh).
- Provides multiple paths for data transmission.

Advantages:
+ High fault tolerance and reliability.
+ Robust data delivery through redundant paths.

Disadvantages:
- Expensive due to cabling.
- Difficult to set up and maintain.

--------------------------------

5. TREE TOPOLOGY (HIERARCHICAL)
-------------------------------
Description:
- Hybrid of star and bus topologies.
- Devices are arranged in a hierarchy with branches.

Advantages:
+ Scalable and organized.
+ Easy to manage different network sections.

Disadvantages:
- Backbone failure can impact the network.
- Uses more cabling than bus topology.

--------------------------------

6. HYBRID TOPOLOGY
------------------
Description:
- Combination of two or more topologies (e.g., star + mesh).

Advantages:
+ Highly flexible and scalable.
+ Fault in one section doesn’t affect the entire network.

Disadvantages:
- Complex configuration.
- Higher cost due to multiple technologies.

SUMMARY TABLE
=============

| Topology  | Advantages                            | Disadvantages                             |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Bus       | Simple, low cost                       | Limited scalability, cable failure fatal   |
| Star      | Easy to manage, scalable               | Hub failure disrupts all, cabling cost     |
| Ring      | No collisions, predictable flow        | One failure breaks the loop, not scalable  |
| Mesh      | High reliability, redundant paths      | Very expensive, hard to maintain           |
| Tree      | Structured and scalable                | Backbone failure, high cabling cost        |
| Hybrid    | Flexible, section-isolated failures    | Complex and expensive                      |
