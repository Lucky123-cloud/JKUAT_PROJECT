Describe any 2 network models and its implementation

Network models are used to define how data is structured, transfered, and managed btwn devices in a network.
The two models are
- OSI Model - Open System Interconnection (conceptual model)
- TCP/IP Model - Transmission Control Protocols/Internet Protocols (practical)

Implementation of Open System Interconnection(OSI)
======================================================
7. Application - End user services eg browsers, applications
6. Presentation - Translation, encryption and compression of data
5. Session - manages sessions and connections. Open and closes sessions
4. Transport - Movement of Data/reliable Data transfer (eg TCP)
3. Network - Routing of data (eg IP)
2. Data link - MAC addressing and error detection
1. Physical - Hardware Transmission, (cables and signals)

- Mainly used in educational and troubleshooting purposes
- Shows how data is worked on in different layers
- provides a clear understanding of how network fucntions in different layers
- Helps in identifying and solving network problems

Implementation of Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol
=====================================================================
4. Application  7, 6, 5(OSI) - Used for end user application eg email, file transfer, browsing
3. Transport    4            - reliable/unreliable Data tranfer and delivery(TCP/UDP)
2. Internet     3            - Logical addressing and Routing
1. Network Access 2, 1       - Physical Data Transmsion

- used in all modern networks, including the internet
- Governs protocols like HTTP, FTP, TCP, IP, DNS, SMTP
-They are practical in nature
