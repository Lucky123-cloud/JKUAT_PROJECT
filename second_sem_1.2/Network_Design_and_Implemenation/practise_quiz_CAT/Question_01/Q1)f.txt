QUESTION: Outline any five network protocols and describe their operation.
=============================================================================

A network protocol is a set of rules and conventions that govern how data is 
transmitted and received over a network. These protocols ensure reliable, 
secure, and efficient communication between devices.

Below are five important network protocols and their operations:

=======================================================
1. TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL (TCP)
=======================================================

Full Name: Transmission Control Protocol  
Layer: Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4)

Operation:
-----------
- TCP is a **connection-oriented** protocol that ensures reliable data delivery.
- Before data is sent, a connection is established through a process known as the **three-way handshake**.
- Data is broken into segments, each acknowledged by the receiver.
- If a segment is lost, TCP retransmits it.
- At the end of transmission, the connection is properly terminated.

Key Features:
+ Reliable and ordered delivery
+ Error checking and recovery
+ Flow control and congestion avoidance

Use Cases:
- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Email (SMTP, IMAP)
- File transfer (FTP)

-------------------------------------------------------

=======================================================
2. USER DATAGRAM PROTOCOL (UDP)
=======================================================

Full Name: User Datagram Protocol  
Layer: Transport Layer (OSI Layer 4)

Operation:
-----------
- UDP is a **connectionless** protocol used for fast, lightweight communication.
- It sends datagrams without establishing a connection.
- There is **no guarantee** of delivery, order, or error correction.
- Minimal overhead makes it ideal for real-time applications.

Key Features:
+ Low latency
+ No connection setup
+ Efficient for broadcasting

Use Cases:
- Video streaming
- Online gaming
- Voice over IP (VoIP)

-------------------------------------------------------

=======================================================
3. HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL (HTTP)
=======================================================

Full Name: Hypertext Transfer Protocol  
Layer: Application Layer (OSI Layer 7)

Operation:
-----------
- HTTP is used for **transferring web content** between a web server and a client (browser).
- It operates on a **request-response** model.
- The client sends an HTTP request (e.g., GET, POST), and the server responds with the requested data.
- HTTP uses TCP as its transport layer protocol.

Key Features:
+ Stateless communication
+ Supports multimedia and interactive content
+ Works over port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS - secure version)

Use Cases:
- Loading web pages
- RESTful APIs
- Browsing multimedia content

-------------------------------------------------------

=======================================================
4. FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL (FTP)
=======================================================

Full Name: File Transfer Protocol  
Layer: Application Layer (OSI Layer 7)

Operation:
-----------
- FTP is used to **transfer files** between computers on a network.
- It requires a client and a server connection.
- Supports authentication (username and password).
- Data is transferred in plain text unless FTPS/SFTP is used.

Key Features:
+ Allows uploading and downloading of files
+ Directory navigation and file management
+ Can use TCP port 21 (control) and port 20 (data)

Use Cases:
- Website file upload/download
- Backup systems
- Internal file sharing systems

-------------------------------------------------------

=======================================================
5. SIMPLE MAIL TRANSFER PROTOCOL (SMTP)
=======================================================

Full Name: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol  
Layer: Application Layer (OSI Layer 7)

Operation:
-----------
- SMTP is used for **sending and forwarding emails** between mail servers.
- It operates over TCP and handles only outgoing mail.
- Works in conjunction with POP3/IMAP for retrieving mail.

Key Features:
+ Ensures delivery of email to the correct server
+ Works over port 25 (or 587 for secure mail submission)
+ Can be used by email clients and servers

Use Cases:
- Sending emails from client to server
- Relaying emails between servers
- Automated notification systems

=======================================================

| Protocol | Layer         | Type             | Key Use Cases                      |
|----------|---------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| TCP      | Transport     | Connection-based | Web, email, file transfer          |
| UDP      | Transport     | Connectionless   | Gaming, streaming, VoIP            |
| HTTP     | Application   | Request-response | Browsing, web apps, APIs           |
| FTP      | Application   | File transfer    | Upload/download of files           |
| SMTP     | Application   | Mail delivery    | Sending email                      |
