QUESTION: What is a Network Address? Illustrate the distinction between a 
          Physical and Logical Address.
=============================================================================

DEFINITION:
-----------
A network address is a unique identifier used to locate a device within a network. 
It helps in identifying and communicating with devices (computers, printers, routers, etc.) 
over a network, either locally or over the internet.

There are two main types of network addresses: 
1. Physical Address
2. Logical Address

-------------------------------------------------------------
1. PHYSICAL ADDRESS (also known as MAC Address)
-------------------------------------------------------------
- A hardware-based address assigned to a network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer.
- It is **burned into** the NIC and is **unique** worldwide.
- Represented in hexadecimal format (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).
- Operates at the **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model.

Example:
  MAC Address: 3C:52:82:0A:62:1B

Advantages:
+ Unique to each device.
+ Used for communication within the local network (LAN).

-------------------------------------------------------------
2. LOGICAL ADDRESS (also known as IP Address)
-------------------------------------------------------------
- A software-based address assigned by a network administrator or dynamically by DHCP.
- Can change based on the network the device connects to.
- Represented in dotted decimal format for IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) or colon-hexadecimal for IPv6.
- Operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model.

Example:
  IPv4 Address: 192.168.0.10
  IPv6 Address: fe80::1f7c:fea6:1c23:4e5f

Advantages:
+ Enables global identification and routing over the internet.
+ Can be configured or reassigned based on network requirements.

KEY DIFFERENCES: PHYSICAL vs LOGICAL ADDRESS
-------------------------------------------------------------

| Feature             | Physical Address (MAC)         | Logical Address (IP)                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Nature              | Hardware-based                 | Software-based                      |
| Uniqueness          | Globally unique                | Can be reassigned                   |
| Layer               | Data Link Layer (Layer 2)      | Network Layer (Layer 3)             |
| Format              | Hexadecimal (e.g., 00:1A:...)  | Decimal (IPv4) / Hex (IPv6)         |
| Addressing Type     | Local (LAN) communication      | Global (Internet) communication     |
| Changeability       | Fixed (unless manually changed)| Changeable (dynamic or static)      |
