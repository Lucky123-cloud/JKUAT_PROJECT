Subnet Mask


🔍 Definition:
A Subnet Mask is a 32-bit number used in combination with an IP address to divide a large network into smaller, manageable subnetworks (called subnets).

> It helps determine which part of an IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion.

Why is it Important?
- It defines the range of IP addresses in a subnet.
- It tells devices whether the destination IP is in the same network or should go through a router.
- It supports efficient IP address management and network security.

🔧Subnet Mask Format (IPv4):
Looks like an IP address → e.g., `255.255.255.0`

| Subnet Mask        | CIDR Notation | Meaning                            |
|--------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| `255.0.0.0`        | `/8`          | Class A – large networks           |
| `255.255.0.0`      | `/16`         | Class B – medium networks          |
| `255.255.255.0`    | `/24`         | Class C – small networks (common)  |
| `255.255.255.192`  | `/26`         | Custom subnet with fewer hosts     |


📌How Subnet Masks Work:
They “mask” the IP address to identify the network portion.

Example:
- IP Address: `192.168.1.10`
- Subnet Mask: `255.255.255.0`

This means:
- `192.168.1` = Network
- `.10` = Host


🧮 Quick Subnetting Example:
If you have:
- IP address: `192.168.1.0`
- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0` (or `/24`)
- You can have: 254 usable hosts (from `.1` to `.254`)


✨ Real-World Use:
When setting up a network, subnet masks help:
- Organize departments (e.g. IT, Admin, Library) into separate subnets
- Enhance security by segmenting traffic
- Reduce broadcast traffic

📝 Summary Notes:

- Used to divide IP networks into smaller subnets.
- Works with IP addresses to find network vs host.
- Common mask: `255.255.255.0` (aka `/24`)
- Crucial for routing, LAN planning, and network segmentation

🎯 Exam Tip:

> "Explain what a subnet mask is and how it's used in networking."
✅ A 32-bit number that splits IP addresses into network and host portions, used to create subnets for efficient IP management.
