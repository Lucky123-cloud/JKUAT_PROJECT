The TCP/IP Model is the practical model used in the internet today. It has 4 layers.


Layers of TCP/IP Model:
TCP/IP Layer	 Corresponds to OSI Layers	                  Description
Application	     7, 6, 5	                                  Apps, encryption, sessions
Transport	     4	                                          TCP/UDP for reliable/unreliable delivery
Internet	     3	                                          IP addressing, routing
Network Access	 2, 1	                                      Physical transmission and MAC

Protocols You Should Know:
Protocol	                       Layer	                          Description
TCP	                               Transport	                      Reliable, ordered delivery (email, web)
UDP	                               Transport	                      Fast, no guarantee (video calls, streaming)
IP	                               Internet	                          Addressing and routing
HTTP/HTTPS                         Application                        Web communication
FTP	                               Application	                      File Transfer Protocol
DNS	                               Application	                      Resolves domain names to IPs
Ethernet/Wi-Fi	                   Network Access	                  Local network communication
