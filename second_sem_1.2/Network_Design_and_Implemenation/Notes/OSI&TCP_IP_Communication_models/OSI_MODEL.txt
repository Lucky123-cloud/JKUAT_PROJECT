OSI - Open System Interconnection
Is a conceptual framework with 7 layers each having a specific task/job in Networking

7 layers of OSI Model from top to bottom:
Layer	  Name	                  Purpose
7	    Application	              User interface; email, web browsers
6	    Presentation	          Translates data (e.g., encryption, encoding)
5	    Session	                  Manages sessions and connections
4	    Transport	              Reliable data delivery (e.g., TCP, UDP)
3	    Network	                  Routing of data (e.g., IP addressing)
2	    Data Link	              MAC addressing, error detection
1	    Physical	              Actual hardware (cables, NICs, bits on wire)

ðŸ”‘ Mnemonic to remember:

"All People Seem To Need Data Processing"

ðŸ’¡ Important Concepts in OSI:
Encapsulation: Wrapping data with protocol info at each layer (as it goes down)

Decapsulation: Unwrapping data at each layer (as it goes up)

Layer Responsibilities: Each layer only talks to the layer above and below
