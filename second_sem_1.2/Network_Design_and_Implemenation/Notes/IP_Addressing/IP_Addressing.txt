Topic Summary: IP Addressing and Subnetting

üß† What is the topic about?

This topic deals with how **devices identify and communicate** within a network using unique identifiers called **IP Addresses**. It also introduces **subnetting**, which helps in logically dividing a network.

This is part of the **Network Layer** (Layer 3) in the OSI model where routing and addressing take place.


üìå Key Concepts You Should Know:

 1.IP Address
- A unique number assigned to each device on a network.
- Format (IPv4): `192.168.1.1`
- Purpose: To identify the sender and receiver in a network.

2. Types of IP Addresses
| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Public IP | Used on the Internet (assigned by ISP) |
| Private IP | Used inside LANs (like home or school networks) |
| Static IP | Manually configured; doesn't change |
| Dynamic IP | Automatically assigned by DHCP server |

3. IPv4 vs IPv6
| Version | Details |
|--------|---------|
| IPv4 | 32-bit, 4 octets, most commonly used |
| IPv6 | 128-bit, newer, handles more devices |


4. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Assigns IP addresses automatically.
- Reduces manual work and chances of IP conflicts

5. NAT (Network Address Translation)
- Allows many devices with **private IPs** to use **one public IP** to access the internet.
- Used in routers.


üìù Why It Matters in Network Design & Implementation
- Essential for **device communication**
- Required for **Internet connectivity**
- Used in **router/switch configuration**
- Vital in **subnet planning** and **network security**
