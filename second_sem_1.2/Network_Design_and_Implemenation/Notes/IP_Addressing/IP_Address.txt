 IP Address

✅Definition:
An IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

> It's like a postal address, but for devices on a network — it allows them to send and receive data.


🔄Two Main Versions:
| Version | Format | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| IPv4 | 32-bit (4 octets) | `192.168.1.1` |
| IPv6 | 128-bit (hexadecimal) | `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334` |

🔧Structure of IPv4 Address (Common in Exams)

- Written as four numbers separated by dots → `X.X.X.X`
- Each number is 0 - 255
- Example: `192.168.0.1`

📚Types of IP Addresses:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Private IP | Used inside a local network | `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` |
| Public IP | Assigned by ISP, used on the internet | Varies |
| Static IP | Manually assigned, doesn't change | Used for servers |
| Dynamic IP | Assigned by DHCP, changes over time | Most home devices use this |

🎯Why IP Address is Important in Networking:

- Helps in routing data to the correct destination
- Used to configure firewalls, ACLs, and network devices
- Necessary for network communication, internet access, and remote access


📌Common IP-related Concepts in Network Design:

1. IP Addressing Plan – Choosing the right IPs for devices in a network
2. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) – Automatically assigns IPs
3. Subnetting – Divides a network into smaller parts (next part of your question 😉)
4. NAT (Network Address Translation) – Translates private IPs to public for internet use


🧠Example in Practice:

> In a college network:
- Router: `192.168.1.1`
- Lab PC 1: `192.168.1.10`
- Lab PC 2: `192.168.1.11`
- Server: `192.168.1.100`

All these use IP addresses to talk to each other and access the internet.

📝 Summary Notes (Revision Sheet Style):

- IP = Identifier for devices on a network
- Two versions: IPv4 (32-bit), IPv6 (128-bit)
- Types: Private/Public, Static/Dynamic
- Assigned manually or using DHCP
- Key in routing, communication, and device management

🧪 Exam Tip
> "Name and describe any three types of IP addresses." 
✅ Public, Private, Static

> "Explain the use of DHCP in network design."  
✅ It dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices
