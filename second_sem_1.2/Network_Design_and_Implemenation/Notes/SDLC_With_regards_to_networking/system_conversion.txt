System Conversion

Topic: System Development Life Cycle (SDLC)  
System Conversion is a concept from the Implementation phase of the SDLC – this is when the new system replaces the old one.

📘What is System Conversion?

System Conversion is the process of switching from an old information system to a new one.

It’s like moving your belongings from an old house to a new one 🏠 — you want the move to be smooth, avoid breaking things, and settle in quickly.


Why It's Important:
- Ensures the organization transitions successfully
- Helps users adapt to the new system
- Minimizes disruption and risk

📦 Types of System Conversion Strategies:

Method	                      Description	                                              Pros	                                            Cons
Direct Cutover	              Old system is immediately replaced by the new one	          Fast, immediate use of new system	                Risky if new system fails
Parallel Running	          Both systems run side-by-side for a while	                  Safer fallback if new system fails	            Costly, needs more resources
Phased Conversion	          New system is introduced in stages or modules	              Easier to manage	                                May take longer
Pilot Conversion	          New system is implemented in one part/branch first	      Good for testing on small scale	                Might miss broader issues not seen in pilot





✅When is System Conversion Done?

- After system development and testing
- Once training and data migration are complete
- During the implementation phase of SDLC

🔧 Example Scenario:

> A university replaces its manual student registration with an online portal.  
They first test it in one department (**pilot conversion**), then expand to all departments (**phased**), and finally turn off the old system (**direct cutover**).

| Term              | Meaning                                                                 |

| System Conversion | Switching from the old system to a new one                             |
| Key Phase         | Happens during **Implementation** phase of SDLC                        |
| Goal              | Smooth transition, reduce risk, ensure user adoption                   |
| Best Practices    | Training users, having backups, testing before full rollout            |


📌 CAT & Exam Tips:

- Know the **4 conversion methods** (name + description + pros & cons)
- Understand **which method to use when** (e.g., use Parallel for critical systems)
- Be ready to **recommend** a method in a case-study question


✅ Sample Exam Q&A:

> **Q: What is system conversion?**  
✅ It is the process of replacing the old system with a new one after development.

> **Q: List and explain two methods of system conversion.**  
✅  
1. **Parallel Conversion** – Run both systems at the same time  
2. **Direct Cutover** – Switch off old system and turn on the new system immediately
