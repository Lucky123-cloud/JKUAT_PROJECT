1️⃣ Network Switch
✅ Function:
Connects multiple devices (like PCs, printers) in a LAN.

Uses MAC addresses to forward data only to the intended recipient.

Operates at OSI Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).

📌 Key Points:
More efficient than a hub (which sends data to all ports).

Reduces network congestion.



Can be managed or unmanaged (for more control).

2️⃣ RJ45 Connections
✅ Function:
RJ45 is a physical connector used for Ethernet networking cables.

Connects devices to a network interface card (NIC) or a switch/router.

📌 Key Points:
8-pin connector

Used in Cat5e, Cat6, Cat7 cables

Common in LAN setups



3️⃣ Gateway
✅ Function:
Connects two different networks that use different protocols.

Acts as a translator between networks (e.g. LAN to Internet).

Works at OSI Layer 5–7 (Session to Application Layer).

📌 Key Points:
Examples: Modem-router combos, VoIP gateways

Translates between TCP/IP and other protocols (like VoIP, ATM)



4️⃣ Regenerator
✅ Function:
Amplifies and restores weak signals in a digital network.

Used in long-distance transmission to maintain signal quality.

Works at OSI Layer 1 (Physical Layer).

📌 Key Points:
Also called digital repeater

Prevents data loss or errors due to signal degradation



5️⃣ Filter
✅ Function:
Controls and restricts data traffic based on set rules.

Can block unwanted IPs, ports, or URLs.

Found in firewalls, routers, and switches.

📌 Key Points:
Used for security and traffic control

Example: A MAC filter allows only specific devices to connect



✍️ Summary Notes Table:
Device	                             Function
Switch	                             Connects devices in a LAN, forwards data using MAC addresses
RJ45	                             Connector for Ethernet cables; links devices to the network
Gateway	                             Connects networks using different protocols (e.g. LAN to Internet)
Regenerator	                         Boosts weakened signals during long-distance transmission
Filter	                             Blocks or allows traffic based on security rules



🧠 What to Know for CATs & Exams:
Know which OSI layer each device works on.

Be able to compare devices (e.g. switch vs router, filter vs firewall).

Understand how devices contribute to network performance and security.
