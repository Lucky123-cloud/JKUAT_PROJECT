Explain the conditions necessary and sufficient to produce a deadlock(8 marks)

1. Mutual Exclusion
Atleast one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode. Only one process can use the resource at a time.
🛠️ Real-world: Only one person can use a bathroom at a time.
💻 Computer: A printer can only be used by one process at a time.

2. Hold and Wait
A process is holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire more resources held by other processes
🛠️ Real-world: Someone is using a printer and waiting for a scanner that someone else is using.
💻 Computer: A program holds a file lock and waits for network access.

3. No preemption
A resource cannot be forcibly taken away from a process holding it; it must be released voluntarily.
🛠️ Real-world: You can’t forcefully take the keys from someone who is using a car—you must wait.
💻 Computer: A process holding memory must release it; the OS cannot reclaim it forcefully.

4. Circular Wait
A set of processes are waiting for each other in a circular chain.
🛠️ Real-world: Person A waits for Person B’s item, Person B waits for Person C’s item, and Person C waits for Person A’s item.
💻 Computer: P1 holds Resource A and waits for B; P2 holds Resource B and waits for A.
