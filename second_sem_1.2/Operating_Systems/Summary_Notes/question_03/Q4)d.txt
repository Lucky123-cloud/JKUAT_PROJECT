Explain any three methods of deadlock prevention (6 marks)

1. Eliminating Hold and Wait
Ensure that a process requests all required resources at once before it begins execution.
🛠️ Real-world: Before baking, you gather all ingredients instead of fetching them one by one.
💻 Computer: A program requests printer, scanner, and memory at the same time before starting.



2. Eliminating No Preemption
Allow the OS to take away a resource from a process if it's needed by another.
🛠️ Real-world: If you're holding a community bike and someone with an emergency needs it, it’s taken and passed on.
💻 Computer: A process holding memory may be forced to release it so another higher-priority task can use it.



3. Eliminating Circular Wait
Impose a strict order for resource allocation and force processes to request resources in that order.
🛠️ Real-world: Everyone in a queue must ask for service in the same order: ID check → ticket → entry.
💻 Computer: All resources are numbered, and processes must request them in increasing order.
