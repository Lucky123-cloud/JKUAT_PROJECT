Distinguish between a page and a frame(4 marks)
1. Page is a fixe-size block of logical(virtual) memory, whereas a Frame is a fixed-size block of physical memory(RAM)

2. Pages are created by the operating system to divide virtual memory, whereas frames are created to store pages in the main memory.

 Real-world analogy:
Page = sheet of paper with content (your data or code).

Frame = empty drawer in a filing cabinet where that paper is placed.

ðŸ’» Computer example:
A 4KB page from a running program is loaded into a 4KB frame in RAM.
