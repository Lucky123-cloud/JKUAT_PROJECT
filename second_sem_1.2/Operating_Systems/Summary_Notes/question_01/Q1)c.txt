Distinguish between internal fragmentation and external fragmentation(4 marks)

Internal fragmentation happens inside allocated memory while external fragmentation happens in free memory spaces.

Internal fragmentation, memory is wasted inside a block that's too big whereas external fragmentation memory is 
wasted between blocks

Internal fragmentation is Caused when memory is allocated more than needed whereas external fragmentation is caused when free memory is scattered in small parts.

Internal fragmentation occurs when allocated memory has unused space inside a block, whereas
external fragmentation happens when free memory is scattered in small blocks between allocated memory.

Internal fragmentation wastes space within allocated memory, whereas
external fragmentation wastes space outside allocated blocks due to non-contiguous free space.

üåç Real-world Example:
Internal Fragmentation: Imagine you rent a storage unit that‚Äôs 10x10 meters, but you only need 7x7 meters. The extra 3x10 meters inside the unit is wasted space.

External Fragmentation: Think of a parking lot where there are several small empty spots scattered around (e.g., 2-3 cars can‚Äôt park together in the scattered spaces). The total space is enough, but it‚Äôs broken up, so no car can park properly.


üíª Computer Example:
Internal Fragmentation: In computers, if a program is allocated 8KB of memory but only uses 6KB, the 2KB remaining is wasted inside that block.

External Fragmentation: When free memory is scattered across the system in small chunks (e.g., 10KB total but in 1KB blocks), the OS can‚Äôt use it efficiently for larger processes.
