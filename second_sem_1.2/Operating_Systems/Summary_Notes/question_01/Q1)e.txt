Describe any three types of scheduling (6 marks)

1. First-Come, First-served (FCFS)
Defination:
Processes are executed in order they arrive in the ready queue. The first process to arive i sthe fist to be executed
Think of a queue at a bank: The first person in line is served first.

Advantages:

Simple and easy to implement.

Fair in non-preemptive situations.

Disadvantages:

Convoy effect: A long process at the beginning can block shorter processes.

Can cause high waiting times, especially for long processes.


2. Shortest Job First
The process with the shortest burst time (shortest expected execution time) is executed first. This can either
be preemptive (shorstest job arriving can preempt the current one) or non-preemptive

In a print queue, the smaller print jobs (short burst times) are completed before the larger ones

Advantages:

Minimizes average waiting time.

Optimal if burst times are known in advance.

Disadvantages:

Starvation: Long processes may never get executed if short processes keep arriving.

Difficult to predict burst times accurately.


3. Round Robin
Each process is assigned a time quantum (fixed time slice), and processes
are executed in a circular fashion. When the time quantum expires,
the process is put back into the ready queue, and the next process gets its turn.

Example:
A group of people playing a game where each person gets a fixed amount of time to play before passing the turn.

Advantages:

Fair for all processes.

Ideal for interactive systems with many small tasks.

Disadvantages:

If the time quantum is too large, it becomes similar to FCFS.

If the time quantum is too small, it leads to too many context switches, causing high overhead.



4. Priority Scheduling
Definition:
Each process is assigned a priority value. The process with the highest priority is executed first. It can be preemptive or non-preemptive.

Example:
In an emergency room, patients are treated based on the severity of their condition (priority), not the order they arrived.

Advantages:

Useful for real-time systems.

High-priority processes are guaranteed to run sooner.

Disadvantages:

Starvation: Low-priority processes may never get executed.

Difficult to assign and manage priorities effectively.



5. Earliest Deadline First (EDF) (Real-Time Scheduling)
Definition:
Processes are scheduled based on their deadlines. The process with the earliest deadline is executed first. This is primarily used in real-time systems.

Example:
In a factory, tasks that need to be completed first (e.g., urgent machine maintenance) are given higher priority.

Advantages:

Ideal for real-time systems where tasks have strict deadlines.

Minimizes the risk of missing deadlines.

Disadvantages:

Not suitable for systems without strict timing requirements.

Can be complex to implement in non-real-time systems.
