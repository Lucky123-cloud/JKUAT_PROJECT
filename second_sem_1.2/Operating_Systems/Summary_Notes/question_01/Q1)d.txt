Explain what swapping means and state its importance.(5 marks)
This is a memory management technique that where inactive processes are taken from the RAM to disk and the active ones are taken from
disk to RAM this keeps the prgramms running simultanously even though the physicall memory is full

Imagine you have a desk (RAM) that’s full of documents. If you need more space,
 you can move some papers (inactive tasks)
 to a storage box (disk) and bring back other papers (active tasks) when needed.

If you’re running multiple programs (e.g., browser, word processor, music player), swapping helps when the RAM is full. If the word processor
isn’t being used actively, the OS may swap it to disk to free up RAM for the browser.


importance Of swapping:

1. Efficient memory use:  Allows the OS to run more processes than the available RAM by swapping out less critical processes.

2. Prevents system Crashes - Helps avoid crashes when memory is fully utilized by temporarily moving data to disk.

3. Improved multitasking - Enables smoother multitasking by managing memory more flexibly.

4. Enables running large Applications: Swapping allows large applications that need more memory than the system’s RAM
 can handle to run by temporarily offloading less critical data to the disk.
