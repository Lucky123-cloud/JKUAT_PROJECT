Explain the meaning of the following terms(10marks)

i) Multi programming - This is when the OS keeps two or more programms in the memory
and switches between them so that CPU doesn't stay idle.
This way, while one program is waiting (like for user input or a file), another can use the CPU — making better use of system resources.

ii) Deadlock - Is a situation when two or more processes, block each other by holding resources
that the other needs, and none can move forward
Deadlock is a situation in an operating system where two or more processes are stuck waiting for each other forever, and none can continue.

iii) Mutual Exclusion - means only one process at a time, can access a shared resource(like a file, variable, or printer) to prevent conflicts or errors.
Mutual Exclusion ensures that when one process is using a shared resource, others are blocked from using it at the same time.

iv) Remote Procedure Call - Is a protocol that allows a process to execute a prodecure(function) on a remote system
as if it were a local call.
RPC helps processes on different computers communicate and work together, while making it look like they're just calling local functions.
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a way for a program to call a function on another computer as if it were calling a local function.
RPC lets a program run code on another machine without worrying about the network details — it feels like a normal function call.

v) Buffer overflow - Happens when a program writes more data into buffer(temporary storage) than it can hold, spilling into nearby memory which can cause
overriding of that memory
