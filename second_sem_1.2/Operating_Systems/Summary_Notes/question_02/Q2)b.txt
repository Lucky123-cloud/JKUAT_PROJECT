Differentaite between a process and a thread:
A process is an independant program in execution with its own memory space and resources whereas a thread is a smaller unit of execution within a process that shares
the same memory and resources of that process.


Process VS Thread
A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space and resources.	A thread is a smaller unit of execution within a process that shares the same memory and resources of that process.
Processes do not share memory space with other processes.	Threads share memory and resources with other threads of the same process.
Communication between processes (IPC) is complex and slower.	Communication between threads is faster because they share memory.
Processes are heavyweight; creating them takes more time and system resources.	Threads are lightweight and quicker to create and manage.
