State any three reasons for process termination (6 marks)

1. Normal completion(Successful execution)
    A process finishes its task and exits normally.
    Example: A text editor saves a file and the user closes it.

2. Error or Exception (Runtime Error)
    The process encounters an error that it cannot handle (e.g., division by zero, missing file).
    Example: A program crashes because it tries to open a file that doesnâ€™t exist.

3. Killed By another Process (e.g., by the OS or User)
    The process is forcibly terminated by another process or the operating system.
    Example: A user uses Task Manager or kill command to stop a frozen application.

4. Resource Unavailability
    A process is terminated because it requests a resource (like memory or I/O) that is unavailable or exhausted.
    Example: A program crashes due to running out of RAM.

5. Parent Process Termination
    If a parent process terminates, the operating system may also terminate its child processes.
    Example: Closing a terminal may terminate background scripts started from it.

6. Timeout or Time Limit Exceeded
    Some processes are given a time limit to complete; if they exceed this, they are killed.
    Example: In online compilers or exam systems, long-running code is automatically stopped.

7. Security Violation
    The process tries to access unauthorized memory or perform restricted operations.
    Example: A malware process is detected and killed by the system.

8. Deadlock Involvement
    A process is terminated by the OS as part of deadlock recovery when no progress is possible.
    Example: Killing one of the processes stuck waiting for each other to free up resources.
