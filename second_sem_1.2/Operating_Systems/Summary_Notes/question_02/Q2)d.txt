Describe the process lifecycle (10 marks)

New → Ready → Running → Waiting → Ready → Running → Terminated

 1. New (Creation)
The process is being created by the system (using system calls like fork() in Unix).

Real-world example: A new tab is opened in a browser but hasn’t fully loaded yet.

Computer example: The OS is allocating resources like memory and setting up the process control block (PCB).


 2. Ready
The process is ready to run and waiting for CPU time.

Real-world example: A delivery truck is packed and ready to leave but waiting for traffic to clear.

Computer example: The process is in the ready queue waiting to be assigned to a processor.

 3. Running
The process is currently being executed on the CPU.

Real-world example: A cashier actively serving a customer.

Computer example: Instructions of the process are being executed by the CPU


4. Waiting (Blocked)
The process is waiting for some event to occur (e.g., I/O completion).

Real-world example: A customer waiting for their food at a restaurant after ordering.

Computer example: The process is waiting to read data from a file or network.

5. Ready (Again)
After the I/O is complete, the process moves back to the ready state to wait for the CPU again.


6. Terminated (Exit)
The process has finished execution or was forcefully terminated.

Real-world example: A movie ends and the screen goes blank.

Computer example: Process exits with a return code; OS reclaims resources.
