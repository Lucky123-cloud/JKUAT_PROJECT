 Preprocessor are commands that are executed before any other  statement  in your program.
  Describe any two such preprocessors used in C++ programming  


  - first of preprocessors are commands/instructions that are processed before the actual compilation of the code begins
  - The 2 main ones are:
        - #include:
            - used to include the content of a file into the current file
            - #include<filename> #include<iostream>
        
        - #define:
            - Used to create a MACRO or a CONSTANT to the file so that it can be resued
            -#define MACRO/CONSTANT #define PI = 3.14259
        -#ifndef and #pragma are others. We will research on them.
