Define what a pointer  is and describe two operators associated with it operation.



A pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable.
The two key operators used with pointers are:

& → Address-of (gets the address)

* → Dereference (gets the value at that address)




example:
 📌 **What is a Pointer?**

A **pointer** in C/C++ is a **variable that stores the memory address of another variable**.

Instead of holding a value directly (like `int x = 5;`), a pointer holds the **location in memory** where a value is stored.

---

### 🔁 **Why Use Pointers?**
- Efficient memory access
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Passing large structures or arrays to functions without copying
- Building data structures like linked lists, trees, etc.

---

## 🧠 **Syntax Example:**

```cpp
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x;
```

Here:
- `x` is an integer variable.
- `&x` is the **address of** `x`.
- `ptr` is a pointer to an integer, and it stores the address of `x`.

---

## 🔧 **Two Main Pointer Operators:**

| Operator | Symbol | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Address-of operator** | `&` | Returns the memory **address** of a variable |
| **Dereference operator** | `*` | Returns the **value** stored at the memory address pointed to |

---

### 📍 1. **Address-of Operator (`&`)**
- Used to get the **address** of a variable.
```cpp
int x = 20;
int* ptr = &x; // &x gives the address of x
```

### 📍 2. **Dereference Operator (`*`)**
- Used to get the **value** stored at the address a pointer is pointing to.
```cpp
cout << *ptr; // This will print 20, the value of x
```

---

## 🧪 Example Putting It Together:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 42;
    int* p = &x;        // p holds address of x
    cout << "Address of x: " << p << endl;        // & operator
    cout << "Value of x using pointer: " << *p << endl; // * operator
    return 0;
}


 🖨️ Output:
Address of x: 0x61ff08   // (address will vary)
Value of x using pointer: 42
