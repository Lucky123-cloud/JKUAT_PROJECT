Ada Lovelace Tribute Website - Project Instructions

Objective:
Create a three-page website dedicated to a personality of your choice (in this case, Ada Lovelace) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).

Requirements:

1. Index Page (index.html):
   - Include a photograph of the person and their last known address.
   - Write a brief biography with subsections: Education, Employment History, and Other Relevant Information.
   - List awards and distinctions earned by the person.
   - Provide a list of relevant references, including links to online materials.

2. Form Page (form.html):
   - Create a form where users can input their name and a question.
   - Use JavaScript to dynamically render the submitted information on the page.

3. Gallery Page (gallery.html):
   - Display a gallery of images related to the person.

General Requirements:
- Include a navigation bar on all pages for easy navigation.
- Ensure all pages have a consistent look (e.g., same header, footer, and styling).
- Apply the CRAP design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity).

Steps to Implement:
1. Create the folder structure:
   - HTML files: index.html, form.html, gallery.html
   - CSS file: styles.css
   - JavaScript file: script.js
   - Images folder: Add relevant images (e.g., ada.jpg, document1.jpg, document2.jpg)

2. Write the HTML for each page:
   - Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <header>, <main>, <footer>).
   - Link the CSS and JavaScript files to the HTML files.

3. Style the website using CSS:
   - Ensure consistent styling across all pages.
   - Use responsive design techniques.

4. Add interactivity using JavaScript:
   - Write a script to handle form submission and dynamically display the response.

5. Test the website:
   - Open the HTML files in a browser to ensure everything works as expected.
   - Check for responsiveness on different screen sizes.

6. Document the project:
   - Write a README.md file explaining the project, its features, and how to run it.
   - Create a instructions.txt file to outline the project requirements and steps.

Deliverables:
- A fully functional three-page website.
- Proper documentation (README.md and instructions.txt).
